# Lab Work Readme

This repository contains the code and datasets used for lab works.

## Lab 1: Dataset Preprocessing

**File:** 1.ipynb

**Description:** In this lab, we perform preprocessing on a dataset containing laptop prices. We clean and impute missing values, remove highly correlated features using a heatmap, and select the most important features using the Gain Ratio algorithm from the C4.5 decision tree classification algorithm. Each transformation is explained and justified.

**Dataset:** [Laptop Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrsimple07/laptoppriceprediction?select=Laptop_price.csv)

## Lab 2: Multilayer Perceptron

**Files:** 2.ipynb 3.ipynb

**Description:** This lab focuses on implementing a multilayer perceptron architecture and the backpropagation algorithm for training the network. We train a perceptron regressor on the preprocessed dataset from Lab 1. Additionally, we process a mushroom classification dataset and train a perceptron classifier on it.

**Dataset:** [UCI Mushroom Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom)

**Additional Notes:** 
- The notebook 2.ipynb utilizes the first dataset
- The notebook 3.ipynb utilizes the second dataset
